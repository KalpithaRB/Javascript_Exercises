Sorting Algorithms

    Sorting algorithms are set of instructions given to the compiter to sort the data in a particualr way, either ascending or descending.



Categories of Sorting algorithms 
    1. Internal sorting algorithms
            -It is applied to small amount of data.
            -Only main memory can be used.
            - eg: Bubble sort, Insertion sort, quick sort
    
    2. External sorting algorithms
            -It is applied to large amount of data.
            -Hard drives and flash drive are used.


Strategies applied during sorting
    1. Recursion

    2. Divide and Conquer
