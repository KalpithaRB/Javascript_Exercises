Linked List
    Linked list is a type of linear data structure.
    It consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a value and a reference (a pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

    Some of the operations done are:
        push, pop, unshift, shift, get, set, insert, remove, and reverse.

    There are Two Types of Linked-List:
        1. Singly Linked List
        2. Doubly Linked List
