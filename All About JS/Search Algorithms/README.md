Search Algorithm

    These Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure when it is stored.


They are classified into two categories:

    1. Sequential Search :
                    The list or an array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. 
                    example: Linear Search.

    2. Interval Search :
                    These algorithms are specifically designed to search in sorted data-structures. These are more efficient as they repeatedly target the center of the search structures and divide that in half.
                    example: Binary Search.
